About S5
========

S5 is a slide show format based entirely on XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With one
file, you can run a complete slide show and have a printer-friendly version as
well. The markup used for the slides is very simple, highly semantic, and 
completely accessible. Anyone with even a smidgen of familiarity with HTML or
XHTML can look at the markup and figure out how to adapt it to their particular
needs. Anyone familiar with CSS can create their own slide show theme. It's 
totally simple, and it's totally standards-driven.
